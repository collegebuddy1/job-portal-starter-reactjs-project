            "description": "About Rumin8\n\nRumin8 is tackling one of the biggest contributors to climate change: methane emissions from livestock. The digestive process of beef and dairy cattle accounts for a full 3.7% of all greenhouse gas emissions, a huge contribution from a single source. With billions of people around the world relying on animal proteins as part of their daily diet, eliminating livestock methane production is a powerful lever in the quest toward a climate-optimal future.\n\nRumin8 has invented a technology that has been shown to reduce the emissions from cattle by up to 95%. Our technology productizes the anti-methane compounds that occur naturally in plants and turns them into dietary supplements for livestock. The results are a reduction in methane emissions by up to 95%, increase in efficiency of the animalâs digestive systems, and more energy for the animal to grow.\n\nWith recent backing by top climate tech VC investors to commercialize the technology globally, we are on a mission to decarbonize hundreds of millions of cattle around the world so the global food system can take a giant step forward. If you believe - like we do - that solving climate change is the greatest calling of our generation and want to get in on the ground floor with us to tackle it, letâs talk.\n\n#LI-Remote\n\nAbout the Role\n\nAs Rumin8 continues to develop its product offering and prepare for launch, we need to fully understand the global landscape of animal agriculture. As our first Senior Strategy Analyst, youâll be the brain trust for all things pertaining to this industry, conducting deep research on the strategic questions most pressing to us and building out extensive market intelligence to empower the company and inform the executive team. Demonstrating relentless curiosity and resourcefulness, you will build our strategic knowledge base, fulfilling internal requests for information and following your own judgment with self-guided discovery. Your insights will shape our commercialization and market entry strategy, and inform all areas of our company. \n\n**Please note: this role is based in the US though the company is currently headquartered in Perth, Australia. You'll be working on a contract basis to begin with as a result. We are beginning to review applications October 5th.\n\n\nAt Rumin8, we don't just accept differences, we celebrate them. We know that diverse teams are the strongest teams. We actively strive to eliminate all manners of discrimination and to enable all qualified humans to collaborate on the massive challenges we are undertaking. Addressing climate change is a challenge worthy of our greatest minds, in all varieties. We know that you will make a positive impact with your unique perspectives, background, and experiences. Our team is excited to build something awesome with you, so come as you are.<br/><br/>Please mention the word **DELICATE** and tag RMjgwMDo0MDozNTo0N2I6MzVhMzo4NDlkOmMwMDo4MDNk when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMjgwMDo0MDozNTo0N2I6MzVhMzo4NDlkOmMwMDo4MDNk).
